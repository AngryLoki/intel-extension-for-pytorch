# Those cases skipped here must have a strong reason that we won't or have very low will to fix
# This file is converted from old json file and those temporary skipped cases are also mixed in
# Once rebasing 2.0 is finished, those cases we should fix will be moved into dynamic_skipped_cases_list.yaml
