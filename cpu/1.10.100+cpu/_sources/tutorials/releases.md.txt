Releases
=============

## 1.10.0

The Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* 1.10 is on top of PyTorch 1.10. In this release, we polished the front end APIs. The APIs are more simplible, stable and straightforward now. According to PyTorch community recommendation, we changed the underhood device from `XPU` to `CPU`. With this change, the model and tensor does not need to be converted to the extension device to get performance improvement. It simplifies the model changes.

Besides that, we continuously optimize the Transformer\* and CNN models by fusing more operators and applying NHWC. We measured the 1.10 performance on Torchvison and HugginFace. As expected, 1.10 can speed up the two model zones.

### Highlights

- Change the package name to `intel_extension_for_pytorch` while the original package name is `intel_pytorch_extension`. This change targets to avoid any potential legal issues.

- The underhood device is changed from the extension-specific device(`XPU`) to the standard CPU device which aligns with PyTorch CPU device design regardless of the dispatch mechanism and operator register mechanism. The interface impactions are that the model does not need to be converted to the extension device explicitly.

- Compared to v1.9.0, v1.10.0 follows PyTorch AMP API(`torch.cpu.amp`) to support auto-mixed-precision. `torch.cpu.amp` provides convenience for auto data type conversion at runtime. Currently, `torch.cpu.amp` only supports `torch.bfloat16`. It is the default lower precision floating point data type when `torch.cpu.amp` is enabled. `torch.cpu.amp` primarily benefits on Intel CPU with BFloat16 instruction set support.

```
import torch
class SimpleNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 128, (3, 3), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)

    def forward(self, x):

- The 1.10 release provides the INT8 calibration as an experimental feature while it only supports post-training static quantization now. Compared to 1.9.0, the fronted APIs for qutization is more straightforward and ease-of-use.

```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(10, 10, 3)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        return x

model = MyModel().eval()

# user dataset for calibration.
xx_c = [torch.randn(1, 10, 28, 28) for i in range(2))
# user dataset for validation.
xx_v = [torch.randn(1, 10, 28, 28) for i in range(20))
```

- This release introduces the `optimize` API at python front end to optimize the model and optimizer for training. The new API both supports FP32 and BF16, inference and training.

- Runtime Extension (Experimental) provides a runtime CPU pool API to bind threads to cores. It also features async tasks. Please **note**: Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* Runtime extension is still in the **POC** stage. The API is subject to change. More detailed descriptions are available in the extension documentation.

### Known Issues

- `omp_set_num_threads` function failed to change OpenMP threads number of oneDNN operators if it was set before.

  `omp_set_num_threads` function is provided in Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* to change the number of threads used with OpenMP. However, it failed to change the number of OpenMP threads if it was set before.

  pseudo-code:

  ```
  omp_set_num_threads(6)
  model_execution()
  omp_set_num_threads(4)
  same_model_execution_again()
  ```

  **Reason:** oneDNN primitive descriptor stores the omp number of threads. Current oneDNN integration caches the primitive descriptor in IPEX. So if we use runtime extension with oneDNN based pytorch/ipex operation, the runtime extension fails to change the used omp number of threads.

- Low performance with INT8 support for dynamic shapes

  The support for dynamic shapes in Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* INT8 integration is still working in progress. For the use cases where the input shapes are dynamic, for example, inputs of variable image sizes in an object detection task or of variable sequence lengths in NLP tasks, the Intel® Extension for PyTorch\* INT8 path may slow down the model inference. In this case, please utilize stock PyTorch INT8 functionality.

- Low throughput with DLRM FP32 Train

  A 'Sparse Add' [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/23057) is pending review. The issue will be fixed when the PR is merged.

### Known issue

* Some workloads may crash after several iterations on the extension with [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc) enabled.

## 1.0.2

* Rebase torch CCL patch to PyTorch 1.5.0-rc3

## 1.0.1-Alpha

* Static link oneDNN library
* Check AVX512 build option
* Fix the issue that cannot normally invoke `enable_auto_optimization`

## 1.0.0-Alpha

### What's New

* Auto Operator Optimization

  Intel Extension for PyTorch will automatically optimize the operators of PyTorch when importing its python package. It will significantly improve the computation performance if the input tensor and the model is converted to the extension device.

* Auto Mixed Precision
  Currently, the extension has supported bfloat16. It streamlines the work to enable a bfloat16 model. The feature is controlled by `enable_auto_mix_precision`. If you enable it, the extension will run the operator with bfloat16 automatically to accelerate the operator computation.

### Performance Result

We collected the performance data of some models on the Intel Cooper Lake platform with 1 socket and 28 cores. Intel Cooper Lake introduced AVX512 BF16 instructions which could improve the bfloat16 computation significantly. The detail is as follows (The data is the speedup ratio and the baseline is upstream PyTorch).

||Imperative - Operator Injection|Imperative - Mixed Precision|JIT- Operator Injection|JIT - Mixed Precision|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|RN50|2.68|5.01|5.14|9.66|
|ResNet3D|3.00|4.67|5.19|8.39|
|BERT-LARGE|0.99|1.40|N/A|N/A|

We also measured the performance of ResNeXt101, Transformer-FB, DLRM, and YOLOv3 with the extension. We observed that the performance could be significantly improved by the extension as expected.

### Known issue

* [#10](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/10) All data types have not been registered for DPCPP
* [#37](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/37) MaxPool can't get nan result when input's value is nan

### NOTE

The extension supported PyTorch v1.5.0-rc3. Support for other PyTorch versions is working in progress.
